# Welcome to WDL Runner!

Welcome to our user-facing documentation for the `wdl_runner` tool!

This is a convenient tool which handles:
 
 * Spinning up a Cromwell server on a GCP VM 
 * Launching a WDL workflow by submitting it to the newly created Cromwell server.

Since github repository documentation can get pretty heavily biased towards developers, these
pages are intended to help new users to:

- Get started with `wdl_runner` from scratch
- Learn how to use `wdl_runner` in a variety of situations

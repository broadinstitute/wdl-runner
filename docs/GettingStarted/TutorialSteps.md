# Quick Start Tutorial

This page is intended to be our first-stop tutorial for those new to using wdl_runner.

## Overview

If you didn't already, you might want to read the overview of what this tutorial is doing [here](TutorialOverview.md).

Otherwise you can jump straight in! All of the steps you'll need to follow are given below. 

## Tutorial Steps

### (0) Prerequisites

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Enable the Genomics, Cloud Storage, and Compute Engine APIs on a new
   or existing Google Cloud Project using the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=genomics,storage_component,compute_component&redirect=https://console.cloud.google.com)
3. Follow the Google Genomics [getting started instructions](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/quickstart) to install and authorize the Google Cloud SDK.
4. Follow the Cloud Storage instructions for [Creating Storage Buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) to create a bucket for workflow output and logging 
5. If you plan to create your own Docker images, then [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#installation)

### (1) Create and stage the wdl_runner Docker image

*If you are going to use the published version of the docker image,
then skip this step.*

Every Google Cloud project provides a private repository for saving and
serving Docker images called the [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/).

The following instructions allow you to stage a Docker image in your project's
Container Registry with all necessary code for orchestrating your workflow.

#### (1a) Create the Docker image.

```
git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl.git
cd runners/cromwell_on_google/wdl_runner/
docker build -t ${USER}/wdl_runner .
```

#### (1b) Push the Docker image to a repository.

In this example, we push the container to
[Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/)
via the following commands:

```
docker tag ${USER}/wdl_runner gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/wdl_runner
gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/wdl_runner
```

* Replace `YOUR-PROJECT-ID` with your project ID.

### (2) Run a test workflow in the cloud

The file [wdl_pipeline.yaml](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl-runner/blob/master/wdl_runner/wdl_pipeline.yaml)
defines a pipeline for running WDL workflows. By default, it uses the
docker image built by the Broad Institute from this repository:

```
docker:
  imageName: gcr.io/broad-dsde-outreach/wdl_runner:<datestamp>
```

If you have built your own Docker image, then change the imageName:

```
docker:
  imageName: gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/wdl_runner
```

* Replace `YOUR-PROJECT-ID` with your project ID.

##### Run the following command:

* Replace `YOUR-BUCKET` with a bucket in your project.

```
gcloud \
  alpha genomics pipelines run \
  --pipeline-file wdl_pipeline.yaml \
  --regions us-central1 \
  --inputs-from-file WDL=test-wdl/ga4ghMd5.wdl,\
WORKFLOW_INPUTS=test-wdl/ga4ghMd5.inputs.json,\
WORKFLOW_OPTIONS=test-wdl/basic.papi.us.options.json \
  --env-vars WORKSPACE=gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/work,\
OUTPUTS=gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/output \
  --logging gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/logging
```

The output will be an operation ID for the Pipeline.

### (3) Monitor the pipeline operation

This github repo includes a shell script,
[monitoring_tools/monitor_wdl_pipeline.sh](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl-runner/blob/master/monitoring_tools/monitor_wdl_pipeline.sh),
for monitoring the status of a pipeline launched using ``wdl_pipeline.yaml``.

```
$ ./monitoring_tools/monitor_wdl_pipeline.sh YOUR-NEW-OPERATION-ID
Logging: gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/logging
Workspace: gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/work
Outputs: gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/output

Preemption retries:
  None
```

### (4) Check the results

Check the operation output for a top-level `errors` field.
If none, then the operation should have finished successfully.

### (5) Check that the output exists

* Replace `YOUR-BUCKET` with the bucket you used in the previous command.

```
$ gsutil ls -l gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/output
        33  2017-10-04T04:22:21Z  gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/output/md5sum.txt
      5264  2017-10-04T04:22:18Z  gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/output/wdl_run_metadata.json
TOTAL: 2 objects, 5297 bytes (5.17 KiB)
```

### (6) Check the output

```
$ gsutil cat gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/output/md5sum.txt
00579a00e3e7fa0674428ac7049423e2
```

### (7) Clean up the intermediate workspace files

When Cromwell runs, per-stage output and other intermediate files are
written to the WORKSPACE path you specified in the `gcloud` command above.

If you wish to remove these files, run:

```
gsutil -m rm gs://YOUR-BUCKET/wdl_runner/work/**
```
